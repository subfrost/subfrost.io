# PART 2: BTC RESTAKING - WHERE THE YIELD COMES FROM

## Page 10: How dxBTC Restaking Works
- **Stake BTC, Earn Yield, Stay on Bitcoin L1**
- **dxBTC User Journey:**
- **Step 1**
    - User signs 1 tx to stake BTC
    - User receives dxBTC (yield-bearing vault token)
- **Step 2**
    - BTC automatically wrapped to frBTC
    - frBTC deployed into ftrBTC futures (block reward futures capturing premiums from miners hedging lock times)
    - Yield compounds in yvfrBTC (aggregation vault with liquidity incentives across BTC/ZEC/ETH/USD markets)
- **Step 3**
    - Yield continuously compounds in dxBTC
    - User unstakes anytime: receives original BTC + accumulated yield
    - All yield sourced from Bitcoin-native operations

## Page 11: Yield Source 1 - ftrBTC: Block Reward Futures
- **Capturing Yield from Mining Pool Partnerships**
- **How ftrBTC Works:**
    - Mining pools in our network mint coinbase rewards into SUBFROST native NFTs
    - NFTs represent claims on locked coinbase outputs (100 block maturity - outdated Satoshi-era consensus)
    - Miners can sell futures early to hedge against lock times and improve liquidity
    - Traders pay premium for early access, creating yield for dxBTC holders
- **Why This Matters:**
    - Modern mining pool centralization enables optimization of outdated coinbase lock periods
    - Steady yield from at least 144 blocks/day (eventually all major pools)
    - True BTC restaking that never leaves Bitcoin L1
    - First protocol with direct mining pool integration for yield generation

## Page 12: Yield Source 2 - yvfrBTC: Market Action & LP Incentives
- **Capturing Yield from SUBFROST Native Markets**
- **How yvfrBTC Works:**
    - Yearn-style vault aggregating yield from multiple sources
    - Gauges incentivize liquidity for main pairs: BTC/ZEC/ETH/USD
    - LP fees and trading volume flow to vault depositors
    - Compounds returns automatically across best opportunities
- **Market Action on the Mains:**
    - Focus on high-volume pairs with real trading activity
    - Swap fees from app.subfrost.io DEX volume
    - Liquidity incentives drive deep markets
    - yvfrBTC captures upside from all market activity
- **Combined Yield Strategy:**
    - ftrBTC creates futures market on Coinbase futures
    - dxBTC deploys frBTC into yvfrBTC for market action on swaps
    - Combined yield from futures premiums + DEX volume

## Page 13: Business Model & Revenue
- **Multiple Revenue Streams:**
- **1. Futures Premiums (ftrBTC)**
    - Premium charged for early access to locked coinbase rewards
    - Capture value from optimizing outdated 100-block maturity

- **2. Trading Fees**
    - Swap fees on all DEX transactions across main pairs
    - Volume-based revenue from app.subfrost.io and partner integrations
    - Future: Limit orders and mempool trading profits
- **3. Wrap/Unwrap Fees**
    - 0.1% fee on frBTC, frZEC, and synthetic wrapping
    - Applied at every entry/exit point to SUBFROST ecosystem
- **4. Vault Management Fees**
    - Performance fee on dxBTC and yvfrBTC yields
    - Management fee on assets under management
- **All Revenue in BTC:**
    - No dependence on token incentives
    - Real yield from real Bitcoin activity

## Page 14: FROST Token Economics
- **FROST Token: The Governance & Value Accrual Layer**
- **Token Utility:**
    - **Governance**: Vote on protocol parameters, gauge weights, partner integrations
    - **Revenue Sharing**: FROST holders earn portion of protocol fees
    - **Gauges**: Direct FROST incentives to liquidity pools for main pairs
    - **Staking**: Stake FROST to earn boosted yields and governance power
- **Value Accrual Mechanism:**
    - **Buy & Burn**: Protocol fees (in BTC) used to buy back and burn FROST

## APPENDIX: Technical Deep Dive (For Future Reference)

## Appendix A: Mining Pool Futures Technical Architecture
- **How ftrBTC Works Under the Hood:**
- **Step 1: Mining Pool Partnership**
    - Existing partnerships with mining pools within project network
    - Targeting at least 1 pool initially, eventually all major pools
    - Pools mint coinbase rewards directly into SUBFROST native NFTs
- **Step 2: Futures NFT Creation**
    - SUBFROST native NFT created atomically with coinbase transaction
    - Entire coinbase reward flows into frBTC reserve atomically
    - NFT represents claim on locked coinbase output
    - NFT can be burned after 30 confirmations to release frBTC
- **Step 3: Optimization & Liquidity**
    - Coinbase lock period (100 blocks) is outdated from Satoshi-era consensus
    - Modern mining pool centralization enables optimization through partnerships
    - Early burn (prior to 100 block maturity) enables futures trading
    - Creates liquid trading paths natively on SUBFROST
    - Miners can hedge new BTC and improve profits with additional controls
    - Traders pay premium for early liquidity, discount at maturity
    - dxBTC captures upside from this optimization
