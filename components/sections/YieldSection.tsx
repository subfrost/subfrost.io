            represents their staked BTC.

          <li>Their BTC is wrapped into frBTC (trustlessly and atomically), and placed in our yield vault.</li>

          <li>
            Users unstake their BTC with us in the simplest way possible (1 transaction). The dxBTC leaves their wallet
            and is replaced with BTC.

          We are built on Alkanes as it is the only programmable metaprotocol (smart contracts) live on Bitcoin Layer-1.
          We are committed to interoperability and will evaluate and expand onto future programmable metaprotocols like
          BRC2.0, when they are ready for mainnet.
